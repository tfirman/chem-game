A game of chemistry

MVP:  A 2 player game in which players alternate taking turns.

There is a 'deck' of 'cards' composed of chemicals - these are goals, when a player completes a card they get points, which is the win condition.

There is a limited 'pool' of elements - both players have access to it, but not every possible element is available at any particular time.

Players start with a random 'card' and three random elements.

A player's turn, in the MVP, will be either taking an element from the pool and adding it to their 'bench', taking a new 'card', or completing a card with elements from their 'bench'.

When an element is taken from the 'pool' it is replaced with a random element.

A player's bench can hold up to ten elements at a time, and three cards.  Cards and benches are visible in the MVP.

The game ends after a specified number of rounds. (when the pool is empty?)

Players get positive score for completing chemicals based on what is listed on the 'card', and at the end of the game lose a point for each uncompleted card.

MVP will be hotseat-style with players alternating turns at the same station - want to go to a server/client based game where each player may not see what the other player sees.  Also,
