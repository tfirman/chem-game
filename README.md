A game of chemistry

MVP:  A 1 player game.

There is a 'deck' of 'cards' composed of chemicals - these are goals, when a player completes a card by assembling all the elements on the card they get points.

There is a communal 'pool' of elements - the player(s) have access to it, but not every possible element will be available at any particular time.

Player(s) start with a random 'card' and three random elements.

A player's turn, in the MVP, will be either taking an element from the pool and adding it to their 'bench', taking a new random 'card', completing a card with elements from their 'bench', or discarding an element from the bench.

When an element is taken from the 'pool' it is replaced with a random element, until the stream is empty.  When the last element is taken from the pool, the game ends.

A player's bench can hold up to ten elements at a time, and they can have up to three cards.  Cards and benches are visible in the MVP.

The game ends after a specified number of rounds. (when the pool is empty?)

Players get positive score for completing cards based on what is listed on the 'card', and at the end of the game lose a point for each uncompleted card in hand.

The next step after the MVP will be a hotseat-style two player game, with the plan after that to have a server serving multiple player client webpages.
